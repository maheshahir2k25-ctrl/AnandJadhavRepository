Design patterns are just tested solutions to common coding problems. They are not rules, but guidelines to write code that is easy to change and maintain.

We generally group them into three buckets:

Creational: How objects are created (e.g., "I need a specific object, but I don't want to worry about the details of how it's built.").
Structural: How objects connect to each other (e.g., "I need these two distinct classes to work together.").
Behavioral: How objects communicate (e.g., "I need this object to notify other objects when it changes.").
